# Emacs Config for Clojure

My Emacs configuration for Clojure development with CIDER and clj-refactor.

## Usage

To use this configuration as your base Emacs configuration, or adapt it to your own configuration, clone, copy, or merge this repository as your `~/.emacs.d/` directory.

Load a Clojure file, and execute `cider-jack-in` (`C-c M-j`).

clj-refactor's prefix is `C-c RET`. It uses mnemonic keywords to provide shortcuts for common tasks. One example of its functionality is introduce let, which would be `C-c RET i l`. To view a complete list of its functionality, hit `C-c RET C-h`.

`neotree` is enabled by default. Use `F2` to set curr dir as root and `F3` to toggle explorer window.

Happy Clojure hacking!
